## **Student Loan Recommendation System with Deep Learning**  
📌 A machine learning model using deep neural networks to recommend student loan options based on financial, academic, and credit-related factors.  

---

## 🚀 **Project Overview**  
This project implements a **deep learning-based recommendation system** for student loans. It analyzes a student's **financial background, education details, and credit history** to provide **personalized loan recommendations**. The model is built using **TensorFlow's Keras**, and data preprocessing is handled with **Pandas** and **Scikit-learn**.

🧠 Model Architecture
The deep learning model follows a feedforward neural network structure:

Input Layer – Takes preprocessed student loan-related features.

Hidden Layers – Fully connected dense layers with ReLU activation.

Output Layer – A sigmoid (for binary classification) or softmax (for multi-class recommendations) activation.

🎯 Key Features
✅ Preprocessing Pipeline – Handles missing data, standardization, and categorical encoding.
✅ Deep Learning Model – Built using TensorFlow/Keras.
✅ Loan Recommendation – Provides personalized loan options based on student data.
✅ Performance Metrics – Evaluates model accuracy and loss using training/testing sets.

📈 Evaluation & Performance
The model is trained and validated using accuracy and loss metrics. Some key steps include:

Splitting data into training and test sets.

Training the deep neural network.

Evaluating performance using classification metrics.

Predicting and recommending loans based on student profiles.

🛠 Future Improvements
🔹 Implement context-based filtering to enhance recommendations.
🔹 Introduce explainable AI (XAI) for transparent loan decision-making.
🔹 Integrate government financial aid suggestions before recommending loans.
